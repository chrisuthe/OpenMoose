# OpenMoose

THIS VERSION IS OLD AND BUGGY. YOU CAN USE IT TO READ AND WRITE YOUR BIN, NOTHING ELSE.
THIS ONLY EXISTS AS A JUMPING OFF POINT. TAKE THE CODE AND MAKE YOUR OWN APP. LEARN HOW IT ALL WORKS.
Flashing doesn't work and non-P2 vehicle support is questionable
Verify your checksum with external checksum tools, just in case
Always have a backup plan: MPPS v18 works great on our ECUs for bench flashing


OpenMoose is a tool for reading, flashing, and datalogging me7 volvos

Use your DiCE cable to flash your car. No paywall, no licenses, no encrypted bins, no bullshit. Just plug and go.

A proper website and fully-functional software with many more features will be announced soon. IT WILL ALWAYS BE FREE.

Fresh builds are dropped randomly in the Volvo Me7 thread on nefmoto
